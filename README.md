# GeoSizer Support â€” Bug Tracker for GeoSizer

<p align="center">
  <em>GeoSizer is the app that allows you highlight the shape of a given geographic feature (such as a continent, country, state, or province), and see what that shape looks like juxtaposed with a different part of the world!</em>

Hey everyone! This is the Support Page for GeoSizer.

If you've never heard of GitHub, it is a website that helps developers like myself organize our code, bugs, and what we're working on. I decided to put GeoSizer's bug trackers and feature requests here instead of any other website because I am here more than I am just about any other website. So if bug reports and enhancement requests are here, then I am much more likely to see them and work on them!

I'm glad you are here! Please see the table of contents for the most common reasons you are here and how you can do them:

Table of Contents:
- Discussions
- Reporting a Bug
- Requesting a feature/enhancement

## [Discussions](https://github.com/ianclawson/GeoSizer-Support/discussions)

If you've got a question but don't want to report a bug / open a feature request, feel free to stop by the discussions page and say hello!

## [Reporting a Bug](https://github.com/ianclawson/GeoSizer-Support/issues)

Thank you for letting me know about an issue you're seeing in the app! I want to make the app the best possible experience for you.

To submit a bug report, do the following steps:
- Click on the "issues" tab near the top of the screen
- Once on the "issues" tab, click on the green "New Issue" in the top right of the page
- Enter a name for the bug in the "title" field
- On the right side of the sceen, click on "Labels" and add the "bug" label to th issue
- Fill out your bug report according to the provided template
- Select the green "Submit new issue" button at the bottom of the text box

And I will follow up with you next chance I get!

:warning: ***NOTE: You can also look through the currently open issues and the previously closed issues to
see what's already been reported before. If an issue is submitted that had already been reported
previously, I will mark it with a `duplicate` label and link the original issue to it so that progress
can be followed in one place, and discussion surrounding the issue can be as centralized as possible.***

## [Requesting a feature/enhancement](https://github.com/ianclawson/GeoSizer-Support/issues)

Thank you for sharing your ideas with me on how the app can be better for you!

To submit an enhancement/feature request, it's almost the same as submitting an issue:

- Once on the "issues" tab, click on the green "New Issue" in the top right of the page
- Enter a name for the enhancement/feature request in the "title" field
- On the right side of the sceen, click on "Labels" and add the "enhancement" label to the issue
